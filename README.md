## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form.
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete.
- Complete the form only using their keyboard.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive/mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)

### What I learned

This project helped strengthen my skills in responsive layout—ensuring equal-width columns, flexible forms with CSS Grid, and absolute reliability across devices.  
I improved my ability to build accessible, interactive forms with real-time validation and clear visual feedback using only semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Example:
```css
.input-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  min-width: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
.input-symbol {
  min-width: 48px;
  flex: 0 0 48px;
}
```

### Continued development

For the future, I would like to:
- Add accessibility enhancements (ARIA, improved keyboard navigation)
- Integrate more complex mortgage types (e.g., variable-rate, extra payments)
- Add result export (PDF or CSV) and historical comparison

### Useful resources
